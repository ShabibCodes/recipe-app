# Okoul Recipes Challenge 

This marks my participation on the Okoul Recipe Flutter Challenge. The challenge was posted to challenge Flutter developer to challenge themselves. 
However, since I am currently learning React Native, I decided to challenge myself and do it using React Native. 

The application currently is 80% done. I upcoming commits will deliver the reset of the features

## Introduction

### Project description

# Okoul Recipes Challenge:

This project aims to develop a mobile app using Flutter framework that enables users to search, view, and save recipes from the Tasty API.
The app will feature a search field for users to enter their queries and display the relevant recipes in a list view.
Clicking on a recipe in the list will navigate the user to a recipe details screen,
which will show the recipe name, photo, rating, ingredients, and instructions. 
The app will also allow users to add and remove recipes from their favorites list,
and it should have a well-designed and maintainable codebase, incorporating good programming practices such as modularization and separation of concerns.
